# quotes
A collection of influential quotes I appreciate.

> "Down to Gehenna, or up to the Throne, He travels the fastest who travels alone." \
— Rudyard Kipling (1917)

> While jostling against all manner of people it has been impressed upon my mind that the successful ones are those who have a natural faculty for solving puzzles. Life is full of puzzles, and we are called upon to solve such as fate throws our way. \
— Sam Loyd, Jr. (1927)

> The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places, but of having a new pair of eyes.\
— Marcel Proust (1871–1922)

> We deliberate not about ends, but about means. For a doctor does not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade . . . They assume the end and consider how and by what means it is attained, and if it seems easily and best produced thereby; while if it is achieved by other means, they consider how it will be achieved and by what means this will be achieved, until they come to the first cause . . . and what is last in the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming.\
— Aristotles, Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, 3, 1112b

> In the time of your life, live—so that in that good time there shall be no ugliness or death for yourself or for any life your life touches. Seek goodness everywhere, and when it is found, bring it out of its hiding place and let it be free and unashamed. \

Place in matter and in flesh the least of the values, for these are the things that hold death and must pass away. Discover in all things that which shines and is beyond corruption. Encourage virtue in whatever heart it may have been driven into secrecy and sorrow by the shame and terror of the world. Ignore the obvious, for it is unworthy of the clear eye and the kindly heart. \

Be the inferior of no man, or of any men be superior. Remember that every man is a variation of yourself. No man's guilt is not yours, nor is any man's innocence a thing apart. Despise evil and ungodliness, but not men of ungodliness or evil. These, understand. Have no shame in being kindly and gentle but if the time comes in the time of your life to kill, kill and have no regret. \

In the time of your life, live—so that in that wondrous time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery of it.” \
― William Saroyan,

> “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.” \
— Volodymyr Zelensky,
